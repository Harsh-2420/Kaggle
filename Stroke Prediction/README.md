# Stroke Prediction 

In this notebook I tried to predict whether a person would have a stroke or not with given parameters. The most eye catching part of this dataset that it has imbalanced target class. 

I followed a general approach on the dataset;

1. Data Cleaning and EDA
2. Scaling the data
3. Dealing with Class Imbalance with SMOTEENN method
4. Comparing Machine Learning models 
5. Hyperparameter tuning with Randomized Search CV
6. Finding best parameters with Grid Search CV

In addition to these, I also tried Future Selection and tried to implement the model with selected features. However, feature selection didn't changed the model accuracy significantly.
