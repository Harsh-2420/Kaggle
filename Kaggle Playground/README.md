<h1 align="center"> Kaggle Tabular Playground Series </h1>

This is a part of the Kaggle Tabular Playground Series (TPS). Each month, Kaggle releases a dataset we can work on to improve our skills in Data Analysis, Cleaning, Visualization and Machine Learning.

Unlike other projects, this does not provide us with any background or information about the features or the target. They are based on some real data and usually generated artificially using a GAN.

Each month consists of a different dataset with unique features and implementations. You can check out the analysis on each there!
