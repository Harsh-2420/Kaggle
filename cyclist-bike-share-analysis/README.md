<h1 align="center"> Cyclist Bike-Share Analysis </h1>


This is the capstone project from the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). 
You can refer to or download the data [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).


<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
In 2016, Cyclist launched a successful bike-share offering in Chicago where they offer multiple pricing plans. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders and those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The financial analysts believe that the annual members are the key to being profitable and that Cyclist should focus on marketing their membership in order to grow. Thus, the company is aiming to convert their casual riders to members and in order to do this, they want to better understand the differences between both riders and their behaviours.

In this project, we aim to clean the data and perform Exploratory Data Analysis to extract insights into both kinds of customers and the trends they follow. We will try to find and capitalise on the customer base they should target marketing at.
